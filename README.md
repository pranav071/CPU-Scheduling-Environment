Introduction
CPU scheduling is a fundamental concept in operating systems that plays a crucial role in efficiently managing the execution of processes on a computer's CPU. It involves determining which process should be allocated the CPU's resources at any given time to maximize system performance and ensure fair distribution of CPU time among competing processes. The choice of scheduling algorithm significantly impacts the overall system responsiveness, throughput, and user experience.
This project explores the implementation and simulation of various CPU scheduling algorithms using Java and a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing. The implemented algorithms include First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Round Robin, Shortest Job First (SJF), and Priority Scheduling. Each algorithm follows a specific policy to decide the order in which processes are executed and for how long.
Features

Implementation of various CPU scheduling algorithms, including FCFS, Round Robin, SJF, and Priority Scheduling.
User-friendly GUI built with Java Swing, allowing users to select the desired scheduling algorithm and specify the number of processes.
Real-time visualization of job execution progress, ready queue, and burst time.
Calculation and display of performance metrics, such as average waiting time, average turnaround time, and total execution time.
Comparative analysis of different scheduling algorithms under various workload scenarios.
Modular and extensible codebase, allowing for easy integration of additional scheduling algorithms.
Detailed documentation and comments within the code for better understanding and maintainability.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following main components:

Scheduler Interface: Defines the common methods that need to be implemented by each scheduling algorithm, such as allocateCPU, enqueue, dequeue, getRemainingProcesses, isEmpty, and peek.
Scheduling Algorithm Classes: FCFSPolicy, RoundRobinPolicy, SJFPolicy, and PriorityPolicy classes implement the Scheduler interface and provide the specific logic for each scheduling algorithm. They maintain a queue of processes using a linked list-based implementation.
ComputationThread Class: Represents a thread that simulates the execution of a job based on the selected scheduling algorithm. It updates the GUI components, including the progress bar, ready queue, and burst time label, to reflect the current state of the job execution.
GUI Components: The project utilizes Java Swing components to create a user-friendly interface for selecting the scheduling algorithm, specifying the number of processes, and visualizing the simulation results. The GUI displays the progress of the currently executing job, the ready queue of remaining processes, and the burst time of the current job.
Utility Classes: Includes various helper classes and data structures used in the implementation, such as Job, MaxPriorityQueue, Node, and Stack.
